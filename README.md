# Bucket

The library is a **storage library** for canisters to manage Stable Memory. \

As far as we know, canisters taht storage data into stable memory have many advantages, such as :
- upgradable (when rts memory goes large)
- larger storage space : Stable Memory can be allocated to 8 GB as present
- no gc cost

Therefore, In order to be compatible with the existing development ecology, we develop two versions :

- [Bucket](#Bucket)
- [Bucket-HTTP](#Bucket-HTTP)
- [demo](https://github.com/PrimLabs/Bucket/blob/main/src/Bucket/example.mo)

You can use this just like using the TireMap.

##  Bucket

- First, you need to import bucket in your project 

   ```motoko
   import Bucket "Bucket";
   ```

- Second, you need to declare a Bucket

   ```motoko
   let bucket = Bucket.Bucket(true); // true : upgradable, false : unupgradable
   ```

###  API

- **put** ï¼šput the value into stablememory,use key to index

  ```motoko
  public func put(key: Blob, value : Blob): Result.Result<(), Error>
  ```

- **get** : use the key to get the value

  ```motoko
   public func get(key: Blob): Result.Result<[Blob], Error>
  ```

- **preupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func preupgrade(): [(Blob, [(Nat64, Nat)])] 
  ```

- **postupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func postupgrade(entries : [var (Blob, [(Nat64, Nat)])]): ()
  ```


**[more details please read the demo](https://github.com/PrimLabs/Bucket/blob/main/src/Bucket/example.mo)**

<span id="Bucket-HTTP"></span>
##  Bucket-HTTP

The difference between Bucket-HTTP and Bucket is that Bucket-HTTP has built-in **http_request**, so people can query files through **canisterID.raw.ic0.app/fk/file_key**

example

```
bs5jn-2aaaa-aaaai-qhtaq-cai.raw.ic0.app/fk/8B091EE0CB685ABD376F7645A6A57E9E118671DF003444C1C13B37E2FCAFCEA7
```

Due to the problem of IC mainnet, HTTP-StreamingCallback cannot work at present, so only files less than or equal to **3M** can be accessed through http.

**We will fix this deficiency as soon as possible.**
