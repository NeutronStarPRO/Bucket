# Bucket

The Project is a **storage standard** applied to canisters.

Its goal is to become a general data storage standard on [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org/) (IC). By using this standard, just **one line of import code**, developers can easily use data storage functions such as put, get when writing canister smart contracts on IC without repeating develop this aspect.

In order to be compatible with the existing development ecology, we develop two version standard:

- [Bucket](#Bucket)
- [Bucket-HTTP](#Bucket-HTTP)
- [demo](https://github.com/PrimLabs/Bucket/blob/main/src/Bucket/example.mo)

You can use this just like using the TireMap.

##  Bucket

- First, you need to import bucket in your project 

   ```motoko
   import Bucket "Bucket";
   ```

- Second, you need to declare a Bucket

   ```motoko
   let bucket = Bucket.Bucket(true); // true : upgradable, false : unupgradable
   ```

###  API

- **put** ï¼šput the value into stablememory,use key to index

  ```motoko
  public func put(key: Blob, value : Blob): Result.Result<(), Error>
  ```

- **get** : use the key to get the value

  ```motoko
   public func get(key: Blob): Result.Result<[Blob], Error>
  ```

- **preupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func preupgrade(): [(Blob, [(Nat64, Nat)])] 
  ```

- **postupgrade**

  ```motoko
  public func postupgrade(entries : [var (Blob, [(Nat64, Nat)])]): ()
  ```


**[more details please read the demo](https://github.com/PrimLabs/Bucket/blob/main/src/Bucket/example.mo)**

<span id="Bucket-HTTP"></span>
##  Bucket-HTTP

The difference between Bucket-HTTP and Bucket is that Bucket-HTTP has built-in **http_request**, so people can query files through **canisterID.raw.ic0.app/fk/file_key**

example

```
bs5jn-2aaaa-aaaai-qhtaq-cai.raw.ic0.app/fk/8B091EE0CB685ABD376F7645A6A57E9E118671DF003444C1C13B37E2FCAFCEA7
```

Due to the problem of IC mainnet, HTTP-StreamingCallback cannot work at present, so only files less than or equal to **3M** can be accessed through http.

**We will fix this deficiency as soon as possible.**

We'd like to collaborate with the community to provide better data storage standard implementation for the developers on the IC, if you have some ideas you'd like to discuss, submit an issue, if you want to improve the code or you made a different implementation, make a pull request!
